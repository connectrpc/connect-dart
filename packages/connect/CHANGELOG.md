## 0.4.1

## 0.4.0

## 0.3.0

- Add `Http2ClientTransport` to manage HTTP/2 connections using PING frames for keep alive. This resulted
  in a breaking change in `createHttpClient` of `package:connectrpc/http2.dart`. `SecurityContext` is no longer
  accepted, and instead replaced by a new `transport` option. The default transport (`Http2ClientTransport`)
  accepts a `SecurityContext`.
