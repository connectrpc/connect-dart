# Eliza

A chat app for [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), a very simple natural language processor built in the 1960s to represent a psychotherapist. The ELIZA service is [implemented using Connect-Go](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-go), is already up and running in production, and supports both the gRPC-Web and Connect protocols.

Try to run the project with `flutter run` on any `dart:io` supported platforms.
